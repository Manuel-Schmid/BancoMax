### Project Information and Demo

We, the three listed contributers, are students in a Cantonal School in Switzerland. 
In one of our classes we were given the opportunity to develop any Project we liked, as long as it was mainly written in Java.
We decided to take on the challenge and code a ATM-system with a more modern interface than the usual ATMs we encounter here in switzerland. 
We also wanted to add more functionality to extend our coding-skills and to have fun. :)

A Demonstration of the project along with some comments and explanations (in german) can be found <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=PUbOALKY0D0

We have written an in-depth project documentation (also in german) which you can find <a href="https://github.com/Manuel-Schmid/BancoMax/blob/main/src/Application/Media/BancoMax%20Project-Documentation.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>

### Achievements

The project was evaluated and we achieved a grade of 6 (which is the best possible grade in swiss schools).
We were very happy about that result and we would like to express our thanks once again to those who have helped 
us in this very exciting and educative project.
